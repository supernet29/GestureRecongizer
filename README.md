# GestureRecongizer
GestureRecognizer project using neural network with accelerator sensor.

# Description
This project is making gesture recognizing application using neural netowrk.

I'm tring to recognize a gesture with accelerator sensor.
Collect sample of gesture by collecting fixed size length sensor data.
After, training with collected sample.
After, predict with window that looks like a queue.
I think it can be recognize a gesture.

# Incomplete
- implement Window
- make gesture recognize tread to recognize (Block less recognize)
- inter thread message passing system.
- realtime gesture recognize.
- testing
